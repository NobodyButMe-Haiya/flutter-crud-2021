// we now keep as simple first

// mostly people want hello world ? not those nasty weird classes ? So how to start
// click  home.dart to  detail.dart as example simple ?
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hola/list.dart';

// this is android style  for now we do this
// will it work ? or not ? we don't know ... test one by one code.. to much time ..
void main(List<String> args) {
  // we need some classes first
  runApp(const MaterialApp(home: ListsView()));
}
